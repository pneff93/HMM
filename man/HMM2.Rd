\description{
Estimation of the transition probabilites, the initial state probabilites and the hidden state parameters of a Hidden Markov Model
by using the Baum-Welch Algorithm.
}
\details{
This function estimates the hidden states of the Hidden Markov Model with the
help of the Baum Welch algorithm. The function iteratively applies both estimation and
maximisation steps to arrive at the predicted parameters. When the maximum difference between
the functions is abitrarily small (see delta) the iteration stops.
